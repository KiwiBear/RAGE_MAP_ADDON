# RAGE_MAP_ADDON
This is just my little map addon for ARMA 3 Exile. 

It contains map content I am producing for Tanoa and eventually other maps. 

This addon should work on any ARMA 3 server.

Just Download and copy the RAGE_MAP_ADDON.PBO into you servers @ExileServer/addons folder and start the server.

If you want to turn certain content off and on, you can adjust that in the globaldefines.hpp.
